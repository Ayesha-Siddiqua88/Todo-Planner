# Todo-Planner ðŸŽ¯

This todo project is quite different from the usual todo projects. This project makes use of Context API from React for State management along with local storage. This is my very first project making use of local storage and its concept is truely interesting. Even on refereshing your page, the todo doesn't disapper as its is stored in your local machine !!

### ðŸ”– Highlights of the Project 
â–ª Let's the user add and edit the todo<br>
â–ª Strike off the todo once completed<br>
â–ª Delete the todo
